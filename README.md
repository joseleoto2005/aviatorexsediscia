## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a **crash game** where players bet on a plane's flight. As
the game progresses, the plane takes off and the multiplier increases.

don't cash out in time, you lose your bet. This adds a layer of
excitement and strategy to the game, making it stand out from
traditional casino games.
